## Midterm Lab Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query Editor 
In this task we are give a raw data from csv to perform data cleaning and transformation using power query

## Task Description:
Company X would like to extract some useful information from the UnclenedDSJObs csv taken
from a Job Posting site available in Kaggle. There are a lot of columns available but focus only
on generating insights that will answer the ff: questions
1. ex. Which Job Roles pay the highest and least
2. What size companies pay the best
3. Where Job Roles or Job Titles pay the best and least in a specific state

## Step 1

- Load the Data in Excel (Data → New Query → Open File → text/csv)
- Load & Edit in Power Query Editor

- Save Proof of Data Cleaning Steps (Home → Advanced Editor → Copy Code)
### Reshaping and Grouping Data
- Duplicate raw data (Sal By Role Type dup)
- Select Columns: Role Type, Min Sal, Max Sal
- Convert Min & Max Sal to currency and multiply by 1000
- Group data by Role Type (Transform → Group By → Average Min and Max Salary)
- Reference raw data for Sal By Role Size ref
- Select Columns: Size, Min Sal, Max Sal
- Convert Min & Max Sal to currency and multiply by 1000
- Group data by Size (Transform → Group By → Average Min and Max Salary)
- Merge State Mapping File with Unclean DS Jobs using State Abbreviation
- Rename merged column to State Full Name
- Remove NULLs and blanks in State Abbreviation
- Reference raw data for Sal By State ref
- Select Columns: State Full Name, Min Sal, Max Sal
- Convert Min & Max Sal to currency and multiply by 1000
- Group data by State Full Name (Transform → Group By → Average Min and Max Salary)
