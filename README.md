## About Me
Hi there! I'm a first-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving, always eager to enhance my programming skills and apply them to real-world challenges. With a decent grasp of C and a growing knowledge of Python, I’m exploring its applications in software development, process automation, and efficient data handling.

As I progress in my studies, I’m excited to dive deeper into areas like programming, databases, and system analysis to understand how technology drives innovation. I enjoy working in collaborative environments where I can exchange ideas, contribute to projects, and continuously develop my skills. Whether through coding challenges, hands-on projects, or future internships, I’m always looking for opportunities to apply what I learn and stay updated with emerging technologies.

Beyond academics, I love experimenting with new coding projects, exploring advancements in technology, and expanding my expertise in software development. My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and contribute to innovative solutions that improve efficiency and drive success in the tech industry. I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact!
